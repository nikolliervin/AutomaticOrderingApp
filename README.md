# AutomaticOrderingApp
This is an automatic ordering app with selenium c#. It takes foods that i input in the app as a list and searches for them, adds the foods to the chart and sets the amount.  It goes through the whole checkout process and orders the food.  I'm currently working on fixing it to work on headless mode and run atuomatically once a week.

You can find the foods and amounts in the dictionary in Products.cs

The checkout details such as Shipping Address can be found in appSettings file
